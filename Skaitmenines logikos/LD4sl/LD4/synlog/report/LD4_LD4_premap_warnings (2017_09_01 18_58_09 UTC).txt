@W: MT462 :"c:\users\z585\desktop\ld4sl\ld4\schemamsk.vhd":131:3:131:5|Net I7.p appears to be an unidentified clock source. Assuming default frequency. 
@W: MT531 :"c:\users\z585\desktop\ld4sl\ld4\schemamsk.vhd":149:3:149:5|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 0 sequential elements including I6.I49.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.
