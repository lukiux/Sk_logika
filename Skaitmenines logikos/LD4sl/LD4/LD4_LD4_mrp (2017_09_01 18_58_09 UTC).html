<A name="mrp_gsr"></A><B><U><big>GSR Usage</big></U></B>
---------

GSR Component:

   The local reset signal 'N_8' of the design has been inferred as Global Set
        Reset (GSR). The reset signal used for GSR control is 'N_8'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
